# Overview

## DC Servo Motor - keyway

2 x Maxon DC Motor
Geared down with positional feedback
Model 241413 / 157073-1-2

Motor has 2 pin power input
2 x 5 idc connector for the rotational sensor
a keyway on the spindle


## DC Servo Motor - pulley

2 x Maxon Motor
Geared with Pulley end and positional feedback
Model 621772 / 2215530

Motor has 2 pin power input
2 x 5 idc connector for the rotational sensor
pulley on the spindle
one of these has a damaged encoder

both the pulley based ones appear to have temperature sensors on
although no connection for that to the servo controller


## Stepper motors

3 x Stepper motors, Nema 23
4 pin
around 55mm deep
no positional feedback


## Fans

3 x case fans
1 x CPU Heatsink Fan

## Drivers

3 x servo controllers

EPOS2
maxon motor
Positioning controller
EPOS2 70/10	375711

Appear to have RS232 / USB / CAN in and out
with CAN ID selector 8 pins

We have 4 servo's but one of the encoders is broken on one
so we should have 3 x servo controllers and motors in total
with 1 motor without a controller and a broken encoder


## Boards - Shunt Regulator

1 x Maxon Shunt Regulator
Model 235811
I think this is used for motor breaking


## Boards - Main Control Board

Don't know much about this yet
other than it's red and probably related to Maxon Motors
